# Deauther V3 Source files 

- Here is the V3 of the Deauther by @SpacehuhnTech, You can use the .faps of version 2 and use this .bin V3 but it will change very little, to see all the changes, you will obviously have to compile the source specifically for the Flipper. soon I will also post here the, faps directly.
